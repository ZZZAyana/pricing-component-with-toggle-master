## Overview

Pricing component with toggle challenge hub. Ð¡hallenge is to build out this introductory component and get it looking as close to the design as possible with using CCS and JS.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS
